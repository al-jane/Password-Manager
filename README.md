# Password Manager
Password Manager using python, tkinter and sqlite.  
## Features
- :bookmark: hashed main password
- :bookmark: able to store username, email, password and the chosen platform.
- :bookmark: user data stored in sqlite
- :bookmark: can display user data (but limited only, still fixing)

## Still working on:
- :o: Copy paste feature
- :o: that stupid bracket that keeps popping on the listbox
- :o: scrollable when displaying user data
- :o: compile and turn it into exe file.

## Installation
Don't. It's unstable. Please wait until I fixed some loop holes and bugs :)
